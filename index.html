  <h1>Grace Hicks</h1>
  <p><strong>Data Analyst focused on customer insights & data-driven strategy</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> SQL, Tableau, R, Excel, Power BI</p>
  
  <p>
    Hi there! I’m a recent data analytics graduate who loves problem solving and collaborating with people to bring insights to life. My experience focuses on understanding customers and supporting strategies that meet their needs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With a background as a Division I student-athlete in track & field, I developed strong discipline, time management, and a love for high-energy, fast-paced environments. In my current role with the Cincinnati Reds, I turn customer data into actionable reports that help teams across the organization make smarter, data-driven decisions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m excited to bring this energy and experience to work that’s active, fun, and truly makes a difference in people’s everyday lives!
  </p>

  
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://pizza-site-vp9y.onrender.com/" target="_blank">Pizza Ordering Web App</a> - This is a full-stack web app I built using Node.js, Express, and Handlebars. Users can browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders in real time. The app runs on Render and connects to a PostgreSQL database, so all data is saved and managed dynamically. It was a fun project to practice building a live, interactive site with a backend and database.</li>
    <li><a href="taylorSwiftDashboard.png" target="_blank">Sentiment Analysis using R</a> – This is a static dashboard I built in R analyzing Taylor Swift’s Fearless and Speak Now albums. It includes word clouds for both albums, visualizes the percentage of positive and negative words, and features scatter plots comparing danceability, valence, and tempo to positive sentiment. It was a fun project to practice text analysis and creating clear visualizations in R.</li>
  </ul>
